<h1>Prime Rib Recipe</h1>
<img src="../images/prime-rib-recipe.jpg">

<h2>Description</h2>

<p>Prime rib is usually the center stage when it comes to the holiday season.
    It is the king of beef cuts because it is a roast marbled with fat and is juicy 
    and tender.
</p>
<p>Prime rib is also very easy to cook. Start the oven at a high temperature to get a good 
    browning outside of the roast. Then, cook it at a lower temperature to ensure the 
    meat in the center doesn't get overcooked.
</p>

<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
    <li>1 (10 pound) standing rib roast, 3 to 7 ribs (estimate serving 2-3 people per rib),
        bones cut away from the roast and tied back to the roast with kitchen string
    </li>
    <li>salt</li>
    <li>freshly ground black pepper</li>
</ul>

<h3>Steps</h3>
<ol>
    <li><strong>Salt the roast and let sit at room temp:</strong> Remove the beef roast from the 
                refridgerator 3 hours before you begin the cooking process. Sprinkle it with salt all over and 
                let the roast sit, loosely wrapped in butcher paper. Roasts should be brought close to 
                room temperature before they go into the oven to ensure more even cooking.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Tie with kitchen string:</strong>
                 If the bones are not already cut by your butcher, 
                cut the bones away and tie them back onto the roast with kitchen string. 
                This will make the carving process easier, while still allowing you to stand 
                the roast on the rib bones while cooking.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Preheat the oven and season the roast:</strong> Preheat your oven to 500 degrees Farenheit.
                Pat the roast dry with paper towels and sprinkle salt and pepper all over the roast.
    </li>
     <li><strong>Place the roast fat-side-up in a roasting pan:</strong> Insert an ovenproof meat 
                thermometer isn't touching a bone.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Brown the roast at high temperature:</strong> Brown the roast at 500 degrees Farenheit 
        for 15 minutes.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Lower the oven to 325 degrees Farenheit to finish roasting:</strong> Reduce the oven 
                temperature to 325 degrees Farenheit. To determine total cooking time, allow for 
                11-12 minutes per pound for rare and 13-15 minutes per pound for medium rare. 
                Roast in the oven until thermometer registers 115 degrees for rare or 120 degrees for medium 
                rare, and 130 degrees for medium.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Let the roast rest:</strong> Once the roast has reached the desired temperature 
                you want, remove it from the oven and place onto a carving board. Cover the roast with foil 
                and let it rest for 15-30 minutes before carving. The internal temperature of the 
                roast will continue to rise while the roast is resting. 
    </li>
